# Information (Over)Load Management

## Introduction

### Maintain an “Inbox Zero”

The Inbox must be empty by default.

* **Archive all old e-mails**
Use a service like Unroll.me (you can google “inbox cleanup” to find alternatives) to massively unsubscribe as much recurring stuff as possible.

* **Check email only at a given time, preferably once a day**
Deactivate smartphone notifications.
If less than 2 minutes to deal with = deal with immediately.
That can definitely include “I choose not to deal with that” and archiving.

* **Schedule anything that takes more than 2 minutes**
Either put in Asana, or snooze to a given date, or leave in the inbox to deal with the same day.
If postponed by more than a day, put in Asana.

* **E-mails from a particular type can be consolidated**
This is called scheduled e-mail bundling. Tools exists for that, more or less based on AI.
After a couple of weeks, consolidate all e-mails accounts on a single, personal Inbox, with rules for replies (to automatically change the sender account to the right one).

* **Non pertinent e-mail source needs to be dealt with immediately**
Unsubscribing, filtering, archiving, spam reporting, or transferring the responsibility to someone else and making clear that you won’t deal with it. Includes spam, newsletters, and regular notifications.

* **Continue multiple, collective or recurring e-mail management**
It will depend on available tools, people and processes.
The best available tools in terms of cognitive load & UX are all Google or come at a cost - time to configure, $$$ or closed system (“best email apps”, ou des services comme FrontApp).

### Brain & work quality

* **Any hint of cognitive overload** like sleep deprivation or negative emotions overtone or repetition is to be treated as seriously and as preemptively as a stroke.**

* **Get proper sleep**
Quality sleep practices (preferably no screens two hours before bed, create bedtime ritual, etc.)
Leave most important decisions for the morning.

* **Mindfulness**
Disengaging the brain: Just more efficient overall in these cases to disengage from anything remotely strenuous intellectually, and to really take care, without guilt. Perfect time to move physically, do absolutely nothing, nap, shower, deep breathe, cuddle, meditate, or dance.
Being extra nice to others at this moment also really helps.

* **Take frequent breaks**
Take a lot of breaks, all the time.
Pauses can last weeks at a time without seriously impacting real-life productivity. We aren’t that required by anything that would crumble in such a short period of time.

* **Make regular brain dumps**
When we think of something to do or think of, we put it in Asana immediately in order to stop it from using background energy to be remembered.
Similar tasks put together in time avoids switching costs.
Alternating between focus (without multitasking) and daydreaming (free thoughts).

* **Stay healthy**: Eat healthy. Exercise regularly. Check eyesight and/or glasses. Get adequate rest. Stay in touch with your friends and family.

* **Have a “rules of thumb” for things** - Some examples:
  * 2 meetings (1 at home, 1 at theirs) + 1 deliverable (even tiny) is often enough to evaluate collaboration capacities with someone
  * 2.5 people complaining about something (ponderate by the strength of their reaction) is the threshold for considering it as something beyond the individuals.
  * In case of suspicion of doubt, anger, frustration, tiredness, cognitive overload, negative emotion, just love someone immediately.

### Social media & Communications

* **Consolidate all social media** including Rocket.Chat like activities to appointed, scheduled times. No compulsive checks of feeds or e-mail

* **Eliminate all notifications** not linked to an emergency. Especially on your smartphone !

* **For people in high demand**, a good way to avoid being swamped all the time follows the same principle than Inbox Zero, if a request takes less than 2 minutes, then it can be done or rejected immediately, otherwise it is scheduled.

* **Pre-scheduled availability**: you can make yourself available specifically for other people's needs at a given time and place of the week, with 4x30 minutes slots - maybe even bookable online). :-p That’s what some politicians do, and it works really well apparently.

* **Typical roles of social media**:
  * Networking - Meh, overrated. Even LinkedIn is not that useful if you’re doing something meaningful.
  * News & Information gathering - See intelligence.
  * Group discussions, Events, Communication, Commenting & Posting - Find alternatives and/or centralize in a collaborative space to divide the load between team members instead of multiplying it by the number of team members. Avoid at all costs direct interactions with Twitter or Facebook in particular. Only access through syndicated, purposeful, collaborative, time-constrained interfaces if possible.


## Consolidate all social media, including Rocket.Chat like activities to appointed, scheduled times. No compulsive checks of feeds or e-mail
## Intelligence on a personal level
## Learn less, quality over quantity
## Intelligence as a network
## Invest in people for your intelligence
## Bottom line:
## Remove as much information hogs as possible!
